# The Radar **Identity Platform**

By [Derren Austen](https://github.com/derren-austen/)

The Radar Identity Platform is an identity provider or IdP created for a single sign-on experience across all of the Radar applications.

It uses OAuth and OIDC...

Built using ASP.NET [Core 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.1) and [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/)

## **Why do we need this?**

Password reuse is bad...
